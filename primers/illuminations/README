I don't really want to give my algo for this problem since I'm still second (lost my first place :'()
But, I used many machines to get my score, and for this I used a ssh/bash architecture I wrote for Hashcode (which happened to be useless for the contest).

Feel free to check it, but it's dirty and sometimes poorly designed, I did it for fun and to learn bash :)

You were warned ! (and, comments are in french. Oh well)
